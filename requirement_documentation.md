The diagrams will represent the relationships, attributes, and functions of our main classes, following the requirements and interactions specified in our requirements documentation.Class Diagrams - Eric & AryanClass DiscriptionsGame ClassThe Game class serves as the central hub for managing the entire gameplay experience. Think of it as the main control system that coordinates different parts of the game. It keeps track of important game information, such as the current level, the status of the game (like if it’s paused, currently playing, or over), and the player’s score. The Game class also handles the critical game state transitions, such as starting, pausing, resuming, and ending the game as necessary. This makes it an essential part of the gameplay experience, as it brings together different elements to ensure the game runs smoothly.Additionally, the Game class manages progression and updates player stats to reflect progress, making it adaptable to various game scenarios. It controls the sequence of events, determining when the player advances or resets, which is crucial for a seamless gameplay flow. As the "brain" of the game, the Game class also serves as an intermediary between player inputs and game responses, coordinating the timing and interactions within the gameplay to maintain a cohesive experience.Pet ClassThe Pet class represents a virtual pet that players can interact with, adding a personal touch to the game. This pet has unique characteristics like a name, health, happiness, hunger, and energy levels, creating a multi-dimensional character for players to engage with. The Pet class allows the player to care for the pet by feeding it, playing with it, or resting it, impacting its health and mood. The pet's responses to these actions contribute to the immersive experience, making it more than just a static element within the game.In addition, the Pet class maintains an inventory for items the player can use on the pet, such as toys and food. This inventory enables the player to customize their interactions, offering different ways to influence the pet's state. The Pet class is essential in creating a sense of companionship, giving the game an emotional layer and encouraging the player to invest in the pet's well-being.Item ClassThe Item class is dedicated to managing the various objects a pet can interact with, each with distinct properties and effects. Every item has a name, a type (such as food, toy, or energy boost), and an effect value, which specifies how it impacts the pet. For example, a food item might replenish the pet's hunger level, while a toy could increase happiness. The Item class ensures items are used consistently and have predictable effects, allowing for strategic gameplay.Moreover, the Item class enables flexibility in player choices by allowing the pet to interact with items in unique ways. This enhances gameplay variety, as players can decide how to use items based on their pet's needs. By categorizing and standardizing item interactions, the Item class plays a crucial role in shaping the player’s experience and fostering a dynamic relationship between the pet and the game world.TetrisGame ClassThe TetrisGame class controls the core gameplay mechanics of a Tetris-style puzzle game within the larger game experience. It manages the grid layout where blocks fall, tracks the player's score, and adjusts the block speed, all crucial elements of the Tetris game. The class also incorporates music tracks, playing background music that heightens the immersion and varies with gameplay intensity, adding a rich, sensory layer to the game.In addition, the TetrisGame class handles the real-time movement and rotation of shapes as players attempt to fit them into the grid. By facilitating interactions between the player and the shapes, it ensures the gameplay is responsive and engaging. The TetrisGame class is integral to bringing the mechanics of Tetris to life, translating player inputs into immediate on-screen action that captures the classic arcade appeal.Shape ClassThe Shape class represents individual blocks within the Tetris gameplay, essential elements that make up the puzzle aspect of the game. Each shape has unique properties like color, starting coordinates on the grid, and the ability to move and rotate, allowing players to strategically position it. The Shape class thus enables interaction, defining how shapes respond to player commands for left, right, and down movements as well as rotations.Beyond basic positioning, the Shape class handles collision detection, determining when a shape has reached the bottom of the grid or is blocked by other shapes. This ensures gameplay integrity, preventing shapes from overlapping in ways that would disrupt the Tetris mechanics. As the foundation of the game’s puzzle structure, the Shape class is key to building a challenging and visually engaging Tetris experience.StatBar ClassThe StatBar class provides a visual representation of key metrics such as health, hunger, or other game-relevant stats, using a bar that fills or depletes based on in-game actions. Each stat bar has a maximum value, and it adjusts accordingly when actions impact the stat it represents. For instance, feeding the pet might increase its health, while neglecting it may lead to a decrease. This functionality makes the game’s health and resource management more tangible for players.Furthermore, the StatBar class creates a more immersive gameplay experience by reflecting changes in real time, helping players track their actions' impact on their pet’s status. It reinforces feedback loops within the game, prompting players to engage in specific actions based on visual cues. This class, therefore, plays a critical role in making abstract game stats accessible and engaging.MusicTrack ClassThe MusicTrack class controls the audio elements in the Tetris game, managing background music to match the game's pacing. Each music track can be played, paused, or even sped up to align with the action intensity, creating an auditory experience that complements gameplay. This dynamic response to game speed amplifies the game's tension, helping players feel more connected to the experience.Additionally, the MusicTrack class allows for customized audio settings, enabling players to interact with the game’s musical environment. By syncing with gameplay events, this class creates a cohesive sensory experience that enhances immersion. The MusicTrack class is thus vital in shaping the emotional tone of the game, adding rhythm and excitement to the player’s journey.GUIManager ClassThe GUIManager class oversees the graphical user interface, ensuring that all game menus, screens, and visual elements are displayed properly. It manages the main menu, in-game screens, and pause screens, allowing players to navigate the game smoothly. By handling transitions between these interfaces, the GUIManager class maintains a user-friendly experience and keeps players engaged.Furthermore, the GUIManager updates the visual elements as the game progresses, reflecting changes in stats, settings, and gameplay. This adaptability provides a seamless visual flow, ensuring that all elements are responsive to the player's actions. By enhancing the player’s interaction with the game’s interface, the GUIManager class plays a crucial role in creating a cohesive and intuitive gaming experience.User Interface Mockup - Aryan1.

It includes features such as:Code Editing: Intelligent code editor with support for Java and XML, providing features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and real-time error checking.Debugging Tools: Comprehensive debugging capabilities, allowing developers to troubleshoot and optimize code efficiently.Performance Analysis: Built-in tools for analyzing app performance, memory usage, and resource allocation, ensuring optimal gameplay experience.Device Emulator: A virtual device emulator that enables testing of the application on various Android device configurations without the need for physical devices.Programming LanguageOur project will be primarily developed in Java, adhering to the requirements for the game to run smoothly on Windows systems. Java is a versatile and widely used programming language, particularly suited for cross-platform development. Its object-oriented nature and extensive libraries make it an ideal choice for developing complex applications like Stellar Pets.External LibrariesWe will be incorporating several external libraries to enhance functionality and streamline development:Gson: A library for converting Java objects into their JSON representation and vice versa. It simplifies the process of handling game data storage and retrieval in JSON format.JUnit: A widely-used testing framework for Java that allows us to write and run repeatable tests. We will use JUnit to ensure our code is robust and free from bugs by implementing unit tests for individual components and functionalities.Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for Android that simplifies the process of making API requests and handling responses. If our game incorporates any online features or services, Retrofit will facilitate these interactions smoothly.DocumentationTo maintain high standards of code quality and facilitate future development, we will utilize Javadoc for documentation purposes. Javadoc is a tool that generates API documentation from comments in Java source code, allowing us to create clear and comprehensive documentation for our codebase. This will include:Method Descriptions: Clear explanations of the purpose and functionality of each method within the code, including parameters and return values.Class Documentation: Overviews of each class, detailing its purpose, relationships with other classes, and any important notes regarding its use.Usage Examples: Sample code snippets to demonstrate how to utilize specific classes or methods effectively.Version ControlTo manage our codebase and facilitate collaboration among team members, we will use Git as our version control system. This will allow us to:Track Changes: Maintain a history of code modifications, enabling us to revert to previous versions if necessary.Branching and Merging: Work on different features simultaneously by creating branches and merging them when they are complete and tested.Collaboration: Enable team members to work concurrently on the codebase, facilitating efficient teamwork and code integration.Development Environment SummaryOur development environment for Stellar Pets will leverage the power of Android Studio and Java, complemented by essential libraries such as Gson and JUnit. By utilizing Javadoc for documentation and Git for version control, we aim to ensure a high-quality codebase that is maintainable, testable, and ready for future enhancements.Patterns - AlexModel-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:The MVC Pattern is an architectural pattern that is used for applications that require a separation of the user interface. It splits it up into three interconnected components:Model - Manages the application data and business logicView - Manages the display given to the user and sends User input to the ControllerController - Manages User input and the Model and View componentsThis model is appropriate for our project as separating the code into different components can help keep the code organized and make it easier to work on certain parts without affecting the whole code.We will implement this pattern through our class diagram.Model (GAME, Pet, TetrisGame, Shape, Item)View (GUIManager)Controller (GAME)The GAME class would serve as the main controller, controlling Pet and TetrisGame instances to monitor the game logic and interacting with the GUIManager to show information. Different game panels may be reflected by the GUIManager's Display Interface methods, and GAME actions would update these screens appropriately.Observer Design Pattern:The Observer Design Pattern is used to define an object that holds the data model/business model, we call this the subject. When changes occur to the subject, it notifies all connected objects (observers) and will update itself based on the new data. This is appropriate to our application because this allows the interface to adapt to modifications made in the data model without requiring a close relationship between these components.Implementation is seen through our class diagram:The GAME class acts as the Subject, it contains the game state information. Any changes that occur to it will affect the observers. being the GUIManager and StatBar. For instance, when GAME updates the score or level, it notifies GUIManager and StatBar to refresh the display, making the UI responsive to game events without direct coupling. Additionally, the Pet and TetrisGame are observers as updateStats() can directly impact the Pet and their traits, while starting, ending, pausing or resuming the game will impact the TetrisGame.Facade Pattern:This structural design pattern is used when there is a simplified interface to complex subsystems. This makes it easier for other parts of the program to interact with each other as it would only have to interact with the Facade class compared to individually understanding each of the classes and their internal workings. This is appropriate for our application because we have a lot of different classes and will need a Facade class to make it more readable and simplified.We implemented this through our class diagram, as the GUIManager will act as our Facade Class. The code is clearer and simpler to comprehend thanks to this Facade Pattern. It offers a single point of entry to all UI elements (MainMenu, GameScreen, PauseScreen). GUIManager handles the update and management of them rather than several classes doing it directly.Additionally, classes such as GAME or TetrisGame can avoid interacting directly with every UI screen by utilizing this Facade. This makes maintenance and modification simpler and prevents code-wide repercussions. For example, changes to the user interface (such as adding a new screen) only need to be made within GUIManager, not across classes, because the GUIManager manages all display logic. Finally, GUIManager makes the code easier to read by providing descriptions of what each method entails as seen through renderMainMenu(), renderGameScreen() and renderPauseScreen().Optional: Additional Diagrams - by TeamHere are a few illustrations our team came up with prior to creating the design documentation. These early sketches and prototypes helped us visualize the app's layout and functionality, from the arrangement of key elements like image placeholders and action buttons to the overall flow between screens. By brainstorming with visual concepts, we refined the user interface, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive design before moving on to the detailed wireframes.Design Documentation Summary - EricThe Stellar Pets project is a mobile-based virtual pet game that combines nostalgic pet care mechanics with an innovative time-based survival model inspired by Tetris.
